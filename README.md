# Written by a human being

> Don't let AI claim your work!

Based on [@krasimir](https://github.com/krasimir)'s [post on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/krasimir-tsonev-67b8b66_chatgpt-activity-7005999761937829888-lj86/) I created this repository which contains various formats for the "Written by a human being" badge.

Feel free to add this badge to your blog or personal portfolio/website to show that the content is written by you - a human being, instead of an AI such as ChatGPT.
